      question: 'Why should I have a e-shop to sell my art ?',
      answer:
        "The advantages of e-commerce related to art aren’t always apparent when people around you tell you that nothing beats physical contact to make sales (which is a false belief) or when you already make sales without the use of a e-shop. However, there are some big perks to adding an online store to your selling options. Your art is available 24/7. You can reach a new audience with search engine visibility. You can create new communication ways around your artwork as visual marketing. You can easily showcase your best artworks. It helps to build a community around your work and thus continue the customer experience. And so on.",

      question: 'People say that nft is just a dead fad, is it true ?',
      answer:
        "Enthusiasm for nft has indeed waned among the general public. But the technology behind nft is still there and has yet to show the full extent of its potential. Because this technology can be seen as a contract of authenticity, nothing more. 'A unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, that is recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership' which is an awesome asset related to copywriting. So at this level of maturity, from the point of view of the general public, nfts are just .jpeg images at astronomical prices. But it's a brand new revolutionary technology, much more useful and valuable than that!",

      question: " How quickly can I expect to have my own online-shop ? ",
      answer:
        "My primary mission is to make you autonomous as soon as possible. However, the web development time depends on the needs of the project and the features used. Generally speaking, 3 months of development are enough to have a first version of a functional website. Then we enter a phase of optimization during which I will add other features and make the website more complex. This phase can take another 3 months. That's why I usually work with people whose sales do not depend on the creation of the website and/or can wait several months before hoping to make sales."

      question: "Why should I decentralize ?",
      answer:
        'For the simple fact that the sales platforms make the most money on your back. They take a percentage of your sales and sell all your information and those of your customers. This is problematic on so many levels. Furthermore they can ban you from their platform overnight for any reason or they can modify the terms and conditions of use of their platform without any means of opposition and use algorithms to force you to use paid options. By having your own website, you hold all the keys and power.',

    //   answer:
    //     "Laziness. Without a doubt ! I often heard that the best programmers are the lazy ones (the Internet even calls for such an attitude in a developer’s work ! ). The way I understand it is: do much better with less. In other words, try to reduce the number of lines of code while remaining functional. That is to say, try to improve the way of coding to gain in efficiency; continue to keep up with the latest technologies and new libraries that allow this kind of progress. Because at the end of the day, all we're looking for is a beautiful and functional website. Nothing more.",

    //   answer:
    //     "The pills are both part of the simulation. Meaning that whether you take the red or the blue pill, you're still part of the Matrix. The so-called 'real-world' is a phony. Neo is seen at the end of the movie to be able to disable the Sentinels by telekinesis, manipulating the 'real world' as he was doing with the bullets inside the Matrix. And when Neo is blinded he still can see the code in the real world, suggesting that he is in fact still in a simulation.",
