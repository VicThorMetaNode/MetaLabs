      question: 'How would you solve problems if you were from Solaris ?',
      answer:
        "I would consider trying to get other entities to appear in order to organize brainstorming with all these joyful people. Then I would evaluate with the team one of my favorite strategies named 7's framework which  is an appropriate checklist for defining and analyzing the most important elements of a group of people. Easy to implement, can be used to accurately analyse the present and future situation, can help to identify gaps and inconsistency in the team, can be used to assess the viability of any strategic plan, and more. Definitely a clear and robust diagnostic model to use on a remote planet.",

      question: 'What do you think about Doris from Nemo ?',
      answer:
        "Doris has been lying to us the whole time ! Dory doesn't suffer from short-term memory loss. In the entirety of Finding Nemo, she's faking it. By applying our knowledge of the common symptoms for short-term memory loss od Dory, we can find cracks in her so-called 'story'. In Anterograde Amnesia (short term memory loss, and cannot form new memories post-trauma), people lose declarative memory: the recollection of facts, but they retain non-declarative memory otherwise known as their procedural memory. Everything she does seems to check out, maybe she does suffer from Anterograde Amnesia... But at the very beginning, when she first met Nemo's father (Marlin), she said 'I've seen a boat'! How could Dory remember the boat but then forget meeting Marlin! The boat wouldn't fall under Procedural Memory. Dory seeing a boat would be a fact. A declarative memory. Which, if she truly suffering from short-term memory loss, she should have have forgotten! Then she's also lying about the cause of her amnesia, telling that it has been passed down genetically. Based on Film Theory. ",

      question: "If you had a choice between two superpowers, being invisible or flying, which would you choose ? ",
      answer:
        'Most of the time, people who fantasize about being able to fly, think more about the idea of being able to travel for free than about all the constraints it implies. I would much rather choose to become invisible. It allows me to do many more things, discreetly, including traveling freely or participating in unimaginable events, for example.',

      question: "What's the most needed skill for a web dev ? ",
      answer:
        "Laziness. Without a doubt ! I often heard that the best programmers are the lazy ones (the Internet even calls for such an attitude in a developerâ€™s work ! ). The way I understand it is: do much better with less. In other words, try to reduce the number of lines of code while remaining functional. That is to say, try to improve the way of coding to gain in efficiency; continue to keep up with the latest technologies and new libraries that allow this kind of progress. Because at the end of the day, all we're looking for is a beautiful and functional website. Nothing more.",

      question: "In the Matrix movie would you rather take the blue or the red pill ? ",
      answer:
        "The pills are both part of the simulation. Meaning that whether you take the red or the blue pill, you're still part of the Matrix. The so-called 'real-world' is a phony. Neo is seen at the end of the movie to be able to disable the Sentinels by telekinesis, manipulating the 'real world' as he was doing with the bullets inside the Matrix. And when Neo is blinded he still can see the code in the real world, suggesting that he is in fact still in a simulation.",
